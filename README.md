# disobey.top source code.

made fully with electron and js

how to compile and make an exe out of it:

npm install

npm start

congratulations you've officially installed disobey.top

APOLOGIES IN ADVANCE, i'm a fucking mess with coding (i luckily understand my code) and there's old stuff that should be removed, will be removed along the next updates if my TDAH allows me to do so, THANKS
